# Ariel's Flow Tools

Welcome to my toolbox of small, simple solutions for real-world workflow problems.

I’m Ariel. I’m not a developer, but I like building lightweight tools that help me and my team stay on track, stay synced, and stay focused. Most of what’s here started with a simple thought: “this would be easier if I just made something.”

These tools are clean, visual, and actually useful. No logins. No ads. No bloated dashboards. Just quick-start tools that work when you need them.

## Why I built this

Sometimes you don’t need a full-blown app — you just need a countdown, a synced timer, or a clear way to show where you are in the hour. I started making these to support my own team’s workflow, especially for remote collaboration, Focusmate sessions, and time-blocking.

## What’s inside

### Timers
- **[FocusTime](https://hellomynameisariel.github.io/focustime/)** *(new!)*: A clean, color-coded session timer made to complement Focusmate and keep you in sync.
- **[FiftyFlow](https://hellomynameisariel.github.io/fiftyflow/)**: A customizable Pomodoro-style break timer built for 50 minute flow states and 10 minute structured recovery.
- **[TimeDrift](https://hellomynameisariel.github.io/timedrift/)**: A visual timer that stays in sync with real-world time blocks. Perfect for short sprints or timeboxing.

### Tools
- **[FocusFrame](https://hellomynameisariel.github.io/focusframe/focusframe.html)**: A minimalist task and time block tracker. Great for focusing on one thing at a time.
- **[WorkLight](https://hellomynameisariel.github.io/worklight/)**: A lightweight way to show team availability and energy levels without micromanaging.

More tools will show up here in the future.

## No distractions. Just flow.
